# New-D365EntraIntegration

## SYNOPSIS
Enable the Microsoft Entra ID integration on a cloud hosted environment (CHE).

## SYNTAX

### NewCertificate (Default)
```
New-D365EntraIntegration -ClientId <String> [-CertificateName <String>] [-CertificateExpirationYears <Int32>]
 [-NewCertificateFile <String>] [-NewCertificatePrivateKeyFile <String>] [-CertificatePassword <SecureString>]
 [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ExistingCertificate
```
New-D365EntraIntegration -ClientId <String> -ExistingCertificateFile <String>
 [-ExistingCertificatePrivateKeyFile <String>] [-CertificatePassword <SecureString>] [-Force] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Enable the Microsoft Entra ID integration by executing some of the steps described in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/secure-developer-vm#external-integrations.
The integration can either be enabled with an existing certificate or a new self-signed certificate can be created.
If a new certificate is created and the integration is also to be enabled on other environments with the same certificate, a certificate password must be specified in order to create a certificate private key file.

The steps executed are:

- 1) Create a self-signed certificate and save it to Desktop or use a provided certificate.
- 2) Install the certificate to the "LocalMachine" certificate store.
- 3) Grant NetworkService READ permission to the certificate (only on cloud-hosted environments).
- 4) Update the web.config with the application ID and the thumbprint of the certificate.
- 5) Add the application registration to the WIF config.
- 6) Clear cached LCS configuration in AxDB.
- 7) Restart the IIS service.

To execute the steps, the id of an Azure application must be provided.
The application must have the following API permissions:

- Dynamics ERP - This permission is required to access finance and operations environments.
- Microsoft Graph (User.Read.All and Group.Read.All permissions of the Application type).
- Dynamics Lifecylce service (permission of type Delegated)

The URL of the finance and operations environment must also be added to the RedirectURI in the Authentication section of the Azure application.
Finally, after running the cmdlet, if a new certificate was created, it must be uploaded to the Azure application.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
New-D365EntraIntegration -ClientId e70cac82-6a7c-4f9e-a8b9-e707b961e986
```

Enables the Entra ID integration with a new self-signed certificate named "CHEAuth" which expires after 2 years.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
New-D365EntraIntegration -ClientId e70cac82-6a7c-4f9e-a8b9-e707b961e986 -CertificateName "SelfsignedCert"
```

Enables the Entra ID integration with a new self-signed certificate with the name "Selfsignedcert" that expires after 2 years.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
New-D365EntraIntegration -AppId e70cac82-6a7c-4f9e-a8b9-e707b961e986 -CertificateName "SelfsignedCert" -CertificateExpirationYears 1
```

Enables the Entra ID integration with a new self-signed certificate with the name "SelfsignedCert" that expires after 1 year.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
$securePassword = Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Enter the certificate password"
```

PS C:\\\> New-D365EntraIntegration -AppId e70cac82-6a7c-4f9e-a8b9-e707b961e986 -CertificatePassword $securePassword

Enables the Entra ID integration with a new self-signed certificate with the name "CHEAuth" that expires after 2 years, using the provided password to generate the private key of the certificate.
The certificate file and the private key file are saved to the Desktop of the current user.

### EXAMPLE 5
```
$securePassword = Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Enter the certificate password"
```

PS C:\\\> New-D365EntraIntegration -AppId e70cac82-6a7c-4f9e-a8b9-e707b961e986 -ExistingCertificateFile "C:\Temp\SelfsignedCert.cer" -ExistingCertificatePrivateKeyFile "C:\Temp\SelfsignedCert.pfx" -CertificatePassword $securePassword

Enables the Entra ID integration with the certificate file "C:\Temp\SelfsignedCert.cer", the private key file "C:\Temp\SelfsignedCert.pfx" and the provided password to install it.

## PARAMETERS

### -ClientId
The Azure Registered Application Id / Client Id obtained while creating a Registered App inside the Azure Portal.
It is assumed that an application with this id already exists in Azure.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: AppId

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExistingCertificateFile
The path to a certificate file.
If this parameter is provided, the cmdlet will not create a new certificate.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ExistingCertificate
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExistingCertificatePrivateKeyFile
The path to a certificate private key file.
If this parameter is not provided, the certificate can be installed to the certificate store, but the NetworkService cannot be granted READ permission.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ExistingCertificate
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateName
The name for the certificate.
By default, it is named "CHEAuth".

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateExpirationYears
The number of years the certificate is valid.
By default, it is valid for 2 years.

Parameter Sets: NewCertificate
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 2
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NewCertificateFile

By default, it is created on the Desktop of the current user.

```yaml
Type: String

Position: Named
Default value: "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\$CertificateName.cer"
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False

### -WhatIf
Executes the cmdlet until the first operation that would change the state of the system, without executing that operation.
Subsequent operations are likely to fail.
This is currently not fully implemented and should not be used.
