As part of the application lifecycle management, cmdlets may become deprecated. In that case, the documentation of the cmdlet should be updated to inform about the deprecation and possible alternatives. After a 6 month period, the cmdlet shoud be removed.

To track the deprecation and removal of a cmdlet, an issue should be created that should be labeled [deprecation](../labels/deprecation).
